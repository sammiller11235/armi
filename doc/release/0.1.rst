ARMI v0.1 Release Notes
=======================

ARMI v0.1.0
===========
Release Date: 2019-10-31

Initial public release.

ARMI v0.1.1
===========
Release Date: 2019-11-15

User-facing enhancements
------------------------
* Added C5G7 sample LWR inputs
* Slightly improved installation documentation
* Improved ability to input subassembly geometric details by adding
  grid definitions to blueprints files
* Demoted ``mpi4py`` to an optional requirement to ease installation
  process.

Backend changes
---------------
* Removed need for geometry object for Reactor construction
* Pushed symmetry and geomType metadata onto spatialGrids
* Turned off auto-conversion of HDF5 DBs to a previous format

ARMI v0.1.2
===========
Release Date: 2019-11-16

Hotfixes
--------
* Fixed dependency issue with pympler

ARMI v0.1.3-dev
===============
Release Date: TBD

User-facing enhancements
------------------------
* Improved flexibility of nuclide flags input by adding an ``expandTo`` section so
  users can control precisely which isotopes the elements get expanded into.
* Improved migration system, accessible with ``python3 -m armi migrate-inputs``
* Added new material modifications for inputting fuels made of mixtures of two 
  custom isotopic vectors

Bugfixes
--------
* SuiteBuilder handles smear density dimension changes for parameter sweeps again
* Fixed broken documentation printout of Flags

Backend changes
---------------
* Number fractions are now maintained across elemental expansion subsets. This slightly changes
  the isotopic composition when, for example, Tungsten is expanded to 4 out of the 
  5 natural isotopes.
